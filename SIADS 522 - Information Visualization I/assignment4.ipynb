    "\n",
    "- Review, reflect on, and apply the concepts of encoding different data types. Given a visualization, justify different encodings for certain datatypes.\n",
    "- Review, reflect on, and apply good design decisions in a visualization. Given a visualization critique design decisions according to principles like Tufte's data-ink ratio, graphical integrity, chart junk, Munzner's rules of thumb, etc.\n",

    "- Article by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) available  [online](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/) (Hickey, Koeze, Dottle, Wezerek 2017)  \n",

    "### Important notes:\n",
    "1) Depending on your operating system and browser combination your emojis may not exactly match ours or the ones from 538. That's fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Grading for this assignment is entirely done by a human grader. They will be running tests on the functions we ask you to create. This means there is no autograding (submitting through the autograder will result in an error). You are expected to test and validate your own code. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keep your notebooks clean and readable. If your code is highly messy or inefficient you will get a deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Follow the instructions for submission on Coursera. You will be providing us a generated link to a read-only version of your notebook and a PDF. When turning in your PDF, please use the File -> Print -> Save as PDF option ***from your browser***. Do ***not*** use the File->Download as->PDF option. Complete instructions for this are under Resources in the Coursera page for this class. If you're having trouble with printing, take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/PiO-K7AoWjk).\n",

    "Design Principle: Chart Junk\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: The presence of the Muhammad Ali graphics give the immediate impression that this chart is talking about and is sort of a testimonial to his career. The graphics frame the chart and also fill up the empty space within, which makes them quite eye-catching and the chart as a whole memorable. The nature of some of the graphics (i.e. Muhammad Ali standing victorious over his opponent on the ground) also unequivocally indicate that the chart provides emphasis on Muhammad Ali's wins (56 wins and only 5 losses in his whole career!), which would likely make any fan of his want to go over the chart in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons: The actual data lies in the Sunburst Diagram part of the chart. The graphics, while relevant to the subject matter of the data, tend to take up a lot of the chart space. This has the effect of dominating the visual and taking away focus from the data (especially for a person who isn't a fan or has never heard of Muhammad Ali before, discouraging them from scrutinizing the data), thereby diminishing the intent of the chart. Moreover, the graphic in the middle of the chart seems to add nothing to the narrative that the chart is trying to convey, making it a redundant and unnecessary part of the chart."

    "We have provided you with some code and parts of the article [The Mayweather-McGregor Fight, As Told Through Emojis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/). This article is based on the dataset:\n",

    "- Recreate the visualizations in the article (replace the images in the article with a code cell that creates a visualization). There are four visualizations to make. For the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, we provide some example code to get the data into the right structure. The points for each visualization are distributed: (30 points: 9 (1st problem) + 7 (each of 2nd, 3rd & 4th)).\n",

    "*IMPORTANT BROWSER ISSUE*: For some non-ES6 Browsers there are problems with date/time conversions (see [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html)). If things aren't working try something like Chrome for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "For the nearly 15,000 people in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, and the millions more huddled around TVs across the world, the Floyd Mayweather–Conor McGregor fight was a roller coaster of emotions. They were anxious as pay-per-view [technical problems](http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20469815/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-delay-ppv-problems) pushed back the fight’s start. They were full of anticipation when the combatants finally emerged after months of hype. They were surprised when McGregor held his own, or seemed to hold his own, for a couple of rounds. They were thrilled when Mayweather finally started fighting. And they were exhausted by the end.\n",

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."

    "\n",
    "This is a really interesting visualization that I thought the article should have included. It is noteworthy that most tweeters in this sample are taciturn at least in terms of emoji usage with a sizable portion of them using just one emoji in their tweets. We can even see that there are nearly 250 of them who do not use a single emoji in their tweets, while some people use more than 80 of them! Since the article talks about trying to tell a story through emoji usage, this vis would've added additional insight to the narrative."
